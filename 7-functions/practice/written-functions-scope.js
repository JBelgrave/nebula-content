// Answer the following questions in your own words
    // 1. What is a function?
    // labelled sections of code

    // 2. Why is it useful?
    // They can be reused in several different areas without needing to make whole new varibales and other code    

    // 3. Give a 'real world example'. Ours was woodchipper. Try and think of something yourself.
    // function calculator(probnlem){
    //    return answer
    //}
        

    // 4. There is different syntax / ways of defining a function write out the syntax for each:

    //     1. Function declaration: 
    // function example(){}


    //     2. Function expressions: 
    // const example = function(){}
 

    //     3. Arrow functions: 
    // const example = () => {}

    
    // 5. What is a parameter?
    // A placeholder for an input to be used in a function when calling it

    // 6. What is an argument?
    // the actual value of an input that gets used in a called function

    // 7. What does the return statement do?
    // return allows a function to give an output

    // 8. What is scope? Do you have a real-world example of something similar to scope?
// Scope determines whether or not a certain piece of code is available elsewhere
// It's like a building with one-way glass, people on one side can see everything outside but no one outside can see inside
